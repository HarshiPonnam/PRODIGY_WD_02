# PRODIGY_WD_02
This is the Second task that is solved for my internship at Prodigy Infotech.
This task has been quiet a challenge for me to solve.
In this task, I have been asked to create a "Stopwatch".
This must contain features to start the watch, being able to pause it and use laps and be able to reset.
I have mostly used Java Script in solving this code, gave design to it using CSS and also used HTML to create a web page.
